Anurag Srivastava:

0) experiment with the variables

1) make sure you're aware of:
a) the independent variables (the one that is allowed to vary freely)
b) the dependent variable (the one you're trying to predict)

2) instead of using SKLEARN he is using ______

Steps:
Prepare the Data
fill in missing values? (you'll do better if you use medians of similar inputs, rather than the global average)
set variable types ()
scale values? etc.
choose a good test/train split (70/30, 80/20, > 60/40)

Zain Hasan:

1) Rapid Review of Linear Regression [0:00 - 10:00]

2) Limitations of LR [10:00 - 14:30] 

a) we would like a model that pays attention to 
the limits of the variables (ranges, physically 
impossible values, discrete categories, etc.)

b) errant extrapolation is possible with Linear 
Regression

3) [14:30 - 29:00] Classification and Regression 
Problems (are related)

"We learned about two different applications of 
supervised learning: a) linear regression and b) 
classification."
